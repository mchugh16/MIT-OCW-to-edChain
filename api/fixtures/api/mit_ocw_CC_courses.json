At the same time, Americans also began to fear the environmental side affects of energy use. Even if the US had enough fossil fuel, would its consumption be detrimental to health and safety? This class examines how Americans thought about these questions in the last half-century.

Most differentiated cells therefore retain all of the genetic information necessary to generate an entire organism. It was through pioneering technology of somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) that this concept was experimentally proven. Only 10 years ago the sheep Dolly was the first mammal to be cloned from an adult organism, demonstrating that the differentiated state of a mammalian cell can be fully reversible to a pluripotent embryonic state. A key conclusion from these experiments was that the difference between pluripotent cells such as embryonic stem (ES) cells and unipotent differentiated cells is solely a consequence of reversible changes. These changes, which have proved to involve reversible alterations to both DNA and to proteins that bind DNA, are known as epigenetic, to distinguish them from genetic alterations to DNA sequence. In this course we will explore such epigenetic changes and study different approaches that can return a differentiated cell to an embryonic state in a process referred to as epigenetic reprogramming, which will ultimately allow generation of patient-specific stem cells and application to regenerative therapy.", "course_features": ["Course Home", "Syllabus", "Readings", "Lecture Notes", "Assignments", "Download Course Materials"]}}, {"model": "api.course", "pk": 730, "fields": {"course_name": "The Politics of Nuclear Proliferation: Nuclear History, Strategy, and Statecraft", "instructors": "Prof. Francis J.

In establishing his theory of natural selection, Darwin set himself, rather self-consciously, to challenge a whole way of thinking about these things. The main focus of attention will be Darwin's contribution to the so-called \"argument from design\" - the notion that innumerable aspects of the world (and most particularly the organisms within it) display features directly analogous to objects of human design and, since design implies a designer, that an intelligent, conscious agency must have been responsible for their organization and creation. Previously, it had been argued that such features must have only one of two ultimate sources - chance or conscious agency.

In this sense, mediums of representation, as external parameters to the design process, are not neutral tools of translating an idea into its concrete form. They are neither authentic means of creativity, nor vapid carriers of an idea. Therefore, an important aspect in issues of meaning is how the architect manipulates the play of translating a concept to its concrete version, through the use of a medium of representation.

Modeling and analysis of these elements is based upon extensive application of physics, mathematics and core mechanical engineering principles (solid mechanics, fluid mechanics, manufacturing, estimation, computer simulation, etc.). These principles are reinforced via (1) hands-on laboratory experiences wherein students conduct experiments and disassemble machines and (2) a substantial design project wherein students model, design, fabricate and characterize a mechanical system that is relevant to a real world application. Students master the materials via problems sets that are directly related to, and coordinated with, the deliverables of their project. Student assessment is based upon mastery of the course materials and the student's ability to synthesize, model and fabricate a mechanical device subject to engineering constraints (e.g. cost and time/schedule).", "course_features": ["Course Home", "Syllabus", "Calendar", "Readings", "Lecture Notes", "Labs", "Assignments", "Projects", "Download Course Materials"]}}, {"model": "api.course", "pk": 1239, "fields": {"course_name": "Microeconomic Theory III", "instructors": "Prof. Peter Diamond", "version": "Spring 2005", "level": "Graduate", "chp_image": "https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/economics/14-123-microeconomic-theory-iii-spring-2005/14-123s05.jpg", "chp_image_caption": "Photograph of sailboats on the Charles River with the Boston skyline in the background.

In this sense, nature is less the object of complex scientific investigation than the object of individual experience and direct observation. Using the term \"nature\" in this sense, we can say that modern reference to \"the environment\" owes much to three ideas about the relation of mankind to nature. In the first of these, which harks back to ancient medical theories and notions about weather, geographical nature was seen as a neutral agency affecting or transforming agent of mankind's character and institutions. In the second, which derives from religious and classical sources in the Western tradition, the earth was designed as a fit environment for mankind or, at the least, as adequately suited for its abode, and civic or political life was taken to be consonant with the natural world. In the third, which also makes its appearance in the ancient world but becomes important only much later, nature and mankind are regarded as antagonists, and one must conquer the other or be subjugated by it.", "course_features": ["Course Home", "Syllabus", "Calendar", "Readings", "Assignments", "Download Course Materials"]}}, {"model": "api.course", "pk": 1290, "fields": {"course_name": "Large-scale Flow Dynamics Lab", "instructors": "Prof. Glenn Flierl", "version": "Fall 2009", "level": "Graduate", "chp_image": "https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/earth-atmospheric-and-planetary-sciences/12-804-large-scale-flow-dynamics-lab-fall-2009/12-804f09.gif", "chp_image_caption": "Animated tropopause maps at 12 hour intervals during the Blizzard of 2003, a typical \"northeaster\" with record breaking snowfall for Boston.

One reason is that decision-making is often driven by a variety of nonscientific, adversarial, and stakeholder dynamics. Thus, even though science helps inform choices, it is only one of many values and interests considered by each stakeholder. In response to this emerging challenge, scientists, and science agencies such as the U.S. Geological Survey, are embarking upon research that explores the problems of incorporating science into value-laden societal decisions. This research includes designing experiments that will assess the appropriateness of using the new and emerging approach of Joint Fact Finding to address some of the Nation's most contentious environmental conflicts.

We will then explore how different presentations in different media can complement and enhance our storytelling.  While we will read scholarly articles and discuss ideas about transmedia, this is primarily a class in making speculative fiction transmedia projects.  We will analyze the strengths and weaknesses of various mediums and consider how they complement each other, and how by using several different media we can give the audience a more complete, rewarding, and immersive experience.", "course_features": ["Course Home", "Syllabus", "Calendar", "Lecture Notes", "Readings", "Assignments and Student Work", "Download Course Materials"]}}, {"model": "api.course", "pk": 2278, "fields": {"course_name": "Microelectronic Devices and Circuits", "instructors": "Prof. Jes\u00fas del Alamo", "version": "Fall 2005", "level": "Undergraduate", "chp_image": "https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-012-microelectronic-devices-and-circuits-fall-2005/6-012f05.jpg", "chp_image_caption": "Schematic diagram of modern metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET): cross section (top), layout at the wafer surface (bottom).
